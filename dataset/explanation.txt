These details (features we will use to predict) are as follows:

X (Patient ID/No): A unique identifier for each patient. This is typically used to track and manage patient data but is not used in the predictive model.

Age (in years): The patient's age, which can be a significant factor in disease prevalence and progression.

Sex (f,m): The patient's gender (female or male), as some diseases may have different prevalence or symptoms in different genders.

ALB (Albumin): A protein made by the liver. Low levels can suggest liver disease or other conditions.

ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase): An enzyme found in the liver, bones, and other tissues. High levels can indicate liver damage or disease.

ALT (Alanine Transaminase): An enzyme mostly found in the liver. High levels can suggest liver damage.

AST (Aspartate Transaminase): An enzyme found in various parts of the body, including the liver. Elevated levels can indicate liver damage.

BIL (Bilirubin): A substance produced by the liver. High levels can indicate liver disease.

CHE (Cholinesterase): An enzyme that can be indicative of liver function. Changes in levels can suggest liver damage or disease.

CHOL (Cholesterol): While typically associated with heart disease, abnormal levels can also be related to liver function.

CREA (Creatinine): Indicates kidney function but can be affected by liver disease.

GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase): An enzyme in the liver, elevated levels can indicate liver damage or bile duct problems.

PROT (Total Protein): The total amount of protein in the blood. Abnormal levels can suggest a variety of conditions, including liver and kidney issues.



# CORRELATION in Dataset


A Correlation coefficient is a number that denotes the strength of the relationship between two variables.
There are several correlation coefficients,

Pearson’s coefficient(denotted by ρ (rho)) - most common used It is defined as the covariance between two variables divided by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.
Formula for correlation coefficient between two variables
Where the covariance between X and Y COV(X, Y) is further defined as the ‘expected value of the product of the deviations of X and Y from their respective means’.

The value of ρ lies between -1 and +1.
Values nearing +1 indicate the presence of a strong positive relation between X and Y, whereas those nearing -1 indicate a strong negative relation between X and Y.
Values near to zero mean there is an absence of any relationship between X and Y.
